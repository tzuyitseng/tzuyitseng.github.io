I am a cognitive-neurolinguist, interested in how language is represented in the human brain and mind across languages. 
My research focuses on understanding how speech sounds, word meanings and emotional cues are encoded and decoded during speech processing,
and how our native language influences the way we hear, understand, and learn a foreign language.<br>

Having studied <a href=https://nccur.lib.nccu.edu.tw/bitstream/140.119/128767/1/004201.pdf">
  <B>semantic and phonological associations in the mental lexicon</B></a> during my MA in Linguistics (National Chengchi University, Taiwan, 2020), 
and <a href=https://hal.science/tel-04988192"><B>sensorimotor representations for native and non-native phoneme perception</B></a> 
during my PhD in Neuroscience (Université Lumière Lyon 2, France, 2025),
I have developed expertise mainly in:
<ul class="custom-bullet-list">
  <li><B>fMRI</B> experiments (3T sparse/continuous sequence)</li>
  <li><B>multi-voxel pattern analysis (scikit-learn/rsatoolbox)</B></li>
  <li>statistical analysis (classification using Python/R)</li>
  <li>speech processing (Praat)</li>
</ul>

In the next phase of my journey, I aim to advance research in neurodivergent populations, 
to better understand how my work can contribute to practical clinical applications. 
At the same time, I seek to refine my methodological toolkit through advanced neuroimaging techniques (e.g., 7T fMRI, M/EEG) 
to investigate the temporal and spatial dynamics of language processing.<br><br>

I'm always open to discussions and I welcome academic collaborations, especially within (but not limited to) 
my current research interests in cognitive psycho- and neurolinguistics with cross-linguistic comparison for:<br>
<ul class="custom-bullet-list">
  <li>sensorimotor representations in language processing</li>
  <li>speech processing of articulatory features</li>
  <li>prosodic encoding of emotions</li>
  <li>structure and access of the mental lexicon</li>
</ul>

Feel free to reach out to me for brainstorming research ideas and potential collaborations!

<br>I am a cognitive-neurolinguist, interested in how language is represented in the human brain and mind across languages. 
My research focuses on understanding how speech sounds, word meanings and emotional cues are encoded and decoded during speech processing,
and how our native language influences the way we hear, understand, and learn a foreign language.<br><br>

Along my research journey, I explored <a href=https://nccur.lib.nccu.edu.tw/bitstream/140.119/128767/1/004201.pdf">
  semantic and phonological associations in the mental lexicon</a> during my MA in Linguistics (National Chengchi University, Taipei, Taiwan, 2020). 
Then, I studied <a href=https://hal.science/tel-04988192">
  sensorimotor representations for native and non-native phoneme perception</a> during my PhD in Neuroscience (Université Lumière Lyon 2, Lyon, France, January 2025). 
Through my research in psycho- and neurolinguistics, particularly in speech production and perception, 
I have developed expertise in<br>
<LI>fMRI experiments (3T sparse and continuous sequence)
<LI>multi-voxel pattern analysis (Nilearn/scikit-learn/rsatoolbox)
<LI>Statistical analysis/Programming (Python, R)
<LI>Speech processing (Praat)</LI><br><br>

During the following journey, I also aim to acquire additional neuroimaging techniques (7T fMRI or M/EEG) and further refine my analytical skills. 
I'm always open to discussions and I welcome academic collaborations, especially within (but not limited to) 
my current research interests in cognitive psycho- and neurolinguistics with cross-linguistic comparison for :
	● Sensorimotor representations in language processing
<LI>Speech processing of articulatory features
<LI>Prosodic encoding of emotions
<LI>Structure and access of the mental lexicon</LI><br><br>
